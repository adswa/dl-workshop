## Goals of the workshop

1. Teach a minimal example workflow to go from data collection to written paper using DataLad
2. Show-case the core functions of DataLad for data maintenance
3. ...

## Goals to support Open Science beyond the workshop

### Extend the [DataLad Handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/)
- We could provide an additional use-case how to integrate DataLad into a reproducible scientific workflow

### Extend the ReproNim/INCF teaching materials on FAIR data
- We could provide additional examples in the ReproNim/INCF teaching materials how the DataLad workflow that we will be teaching in the workshop supports [FAIR data principles](http://www.repronim.org/module-FAIR-data/04-Data-Publishing/).

### Extend the ReproNim / DataLad YouTube channels with a new teaching video
- In case, we are deciding to video-record the entire workshop this video could be uploaded to the DataLad / ReproNim YouTube channels (either or both)
- In case of a remote workshop, we would need to verify that the video-conference software of our choice allows to record the session in such a way that it's useful and pleasant to watch afterwards
