# What will this session teach me?

- Concepts & technology overview and short introduction (containers, computational environments). Whats a container, how can I easily make one (Neurodocker), where can I share one (dockerhub, singularity hub), where can I find existing ones (Repronim container collection)

# Capturing and shating computational environments with software containers

# Hands-on

- sketch of a reproducible analysis/paper


# Summary

# Further reading, helpful links, and background information
