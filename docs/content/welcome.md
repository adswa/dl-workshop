# General logistics

## Video recordings

We hope to record the workshop in order to provide resources for attendees that missed the workshop or want to revisit materials.
However, the final decision will be made together with the participants on the first day of the workshop.
A recording would include the following aspects of the main conferencing room:

- Slides/Screenshares
- Potentially videos of the speakers
- All audio

The recording can be stopped or edited after the workshop to exclude discussions or question sessions.

## Live polling

We are using the tool [directpoll.com](https://directpoll.com/).
