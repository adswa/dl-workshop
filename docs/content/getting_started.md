In order to follow workshop materials, please make sure that you install the relevant software and set it up appropriately.
At the end of this page, a short script can help you to verify that everything works as it should.

If you run into problems, please get in touch **prior** to the workshop.
We are happy to help with installation problems or general questions, but a virtual workshop does not allow for any concurrent user support and help, unfortunately, and we thus won't be able to deal with problems that surface during the sessions. Reach out to us about problems as early as you can by filing an issue on our GitHub repository: [github.com/adswa/mpi-datamanagement-ws/](https://github.com/adswa/mpi-datamanagement-ws/issues/new).

If you haven't set up the software, you will be able to attend the workshop, but not work interactively on the materials.

| **NOTE FOR WINDOWS USERS** |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Previous workshop experiences have taught us that the installation of all required software is more complex on Windows systems. As there is also less available support for Windows users, we generally recommend that anyone who uses Windows should switch to an account on a shared compute cluster instead of using their private PC for this introduction, if possible. This eases the installation effort greatly.|

# Software installation

| **The following software is required to follow along interactively.** Please install it as early as you can |

| **Git**: [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)     |
