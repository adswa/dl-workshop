## When and where will the workshop take place?

On Thursday, April 21st 2022, and Friday, April 22nd 2022 from 9am - 1pm (Berlin time).
The workshop will be held virtually via the video conference system [Zoom](https://zoom.us).

To help shape the workshop to your interests, consider answering [this Google Form](https://forms.gle/vGtkpfNGasutV4Rt7).
We will send out a link and password to the video conference prior to the workshop.

## I can't join both days - is this a problem?

You can join or leave the Zoom call freely during the workshop days.
We hope to record the tutorials and publish them after the workshop, given all attendees are fine with this (see below).
Do note that most elements of the workshop build up consecutively and we can't guarantee that you can join in live participation smoothly at all times.

## Are materials and talks available after the workshop as well?

The workshop materials and this website will be available after the workshop.
We hope to record the tutorials and publish them to YouTube afterwards, but this will be determined at the start of the workshop based on all participants wishes.

## Whom is this workshop for?

Who ever is interested!
We don't require specific technical or study background - if you are interested in finding out about research data management or the tools that we cover, please join us.
