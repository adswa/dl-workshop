In this full-day workshop, organized as part of the Reproducible Neuroimaging ([ReproNim](https://www.repronim.org/)) initiative to improve the reproducibility of neuroimaging science, [ReproNim fellows](#instructors) will introduce core concepts and software tools that can make your next research project easier: Version control, principles for data analysis, data publication, and collaborative scientific workflows.

The workshop will be virtual and free to attend.

# Workshop Contents

The workshop will center around [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/), an open source software tool for data management and data publication.
We will introduce core concepts of good research data management - joint version control of code and data, provenance capture for reproducible analysis, organizational principles for data analysis, and workflows and services for data publication and collaboration - in conjunction with demonstrating readily-applicable workflows or examples.

If you have always wanted to get going with version control, are curious to find out how to use DataLad, or want see simple workflows for reproducible science - from data sharing to reproducible papers - this workshop will be useful and easier than you think.
