# Why would you want to join?

[Research Data Management](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm.html) is a core component of good scientific practice and can help to make your work not only more reproducible and transparent - but also easier.

This virtual workshop, spread over two half-days, will introduce core concepts and software tools that can make your next research project easier: Version control, principles for data analysis, data publication, and collaborative scientific workflows using well-known and free services such as [GitHub](https://www.github.com) or [Gin](https://gin.g-node.org).

The workshop will be virtual and free to attend.

# Workshop Contents

The workshop will center around [DataLad](https://www.datalad.org/), an open source software tool for data versioning, data management and data publication that builds up on the industry standard [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/).

Beyond introducing its functionality, we will cover useful core concepts for good research data management and reproducible, open science:
Version control for code and data, productive usage of services such as GitHub and Gin, provenance capture for reproducible analysis, organizational principles for data analysis, and workflows and services for data publication and collaboration - in conjunction with demonstrating readily-applicable workflows or examples.

This workshop can be interesting for you if you have always wanted to get going with version control, are curious to find out when and how to use DataLad, or want see real-world workflows for reproducible science.
