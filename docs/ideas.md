## General setup

[Google Doc for discussions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lw4o5Q3OMjXgGOyFBUHP--_xv01KJtsY76eViMJJLhw/edit?usp=sharing)

In general, we aim for **one full day workshop** at the MPI Berlin,
but preparations need to make a transition to a virtual workshop
as easy as possible. To ensure inclusivity and accessibility (e.g.,
for attendees with caring responsibilities, risk groups, or other reasons
to stay physically distant), we should provide virtual means of attending.

* Proposed structure: Four 1.5 hour sessions and 30min wrap-up

Time         | Session name               | Contents
:----------- | :------------------------: | -----------:
08.30-09.00  | Arrival                    |
09.00-10.30  | First morning session      | Concepts, Motivation
10.30-10.45  | *Coffee break*             |
10.45-12.15  | Second morning session     | Datalad concepts and principles
12.15-13.15  | *Lunch break*              |
13.15-14.45  | First afternoon session    | Reproducible Science
14.45-15.00  | *Coffee break*             |
15.00-16.30  | Second afternoon session   | Data publication and collaboration
16.30-17.00  | Wrap-up, remaining Qs      | Outlook

## Contents

#### 1 Concepts, Motivation

- Motivation/Benefits for data management, theoretical introduction into
  version control, FAIRness, provenance.

#### 2 Datalad concepts and principles

- Basics of local data/code version control + Hands on: tasks to exercise
  basic building blocks (dataset, datalad create, datalad save, datalad
  clone, datalad push, datalad update)

- Basics of modular data management for reproducible science (YODA principles)
- Demo: Reproducible paper (e.g., https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/paper-remodnav/)

#### 3 Reproducible Science

- Basics of provenance capture and reproducible execution with and without
  software containers (datalad run, datalad containers-run)
- Hands-on: sketch of a reproducible paper

#### 4 Data publication and collaboration

- Basic principles of shared datasets and collaborative workflows
- Hands-on: dataset publication to GitHub/GitLab/Gin (whatever)

#### 5 Wrap-up/Outlook

- Resources
- Outlook into what is possible: DICOM to BIDS conversion, Metadata, ...?
- Questions, maybe discuss usecases

## To do and to plan

#### Infrastructure

* Private computers (without question if virtual), (guest/existing?) user
  accounts on a cluster?
* If if-person: Hygiene standards to comply to
* Recording set up
* Recording publication (platforms, time frame (live streaming, publishing
  post-workshop/...))
=======
* Idea: Migrate this repository to the handbook repository, keep mkdocs, and
  create a github page under the handbook namespace -> easier to find, more
  lasting resource
* Virtual attendance procedures: Client (Zoom/Jitsi/Hangouts), procedures
  for participation (how/when to raise questions, interactivity?)
* Accessibilty: IMO, it can be as open as possible - at least recordings
  and materials should be openly shared. Unlimited *participation* can be
  too difficult to manage if contents are too interacitve


#### Not course-specific TODOs

* Code of conduct
* Post-workshop communication: Means of providing feedback
* Pre-workshop communication: Means of suggesting topics/wishes upfront
