## What (Training Topic)?

Full-day workshops on workflows using DataLad

Site-specific focus:
- **Berlin:** Basic DataLad workflow focusing on data management (e.g., from data collection to paper manuscript)
- **Juelich:** Less data management centric (there are regular data management courses held by Adina anyway), with elements from the data processing module and sneak-peaks into fMRIPrep, MRIQC, BIDS, and other open software tools

## Who teaches (Names)?

- [Adina Wagner](mailto:adina.wagner@t-online.de), Juelich Research Centre, INM-7, Psychoinformatics Lab, Juelich, Germany
- [Lennart Wittkuhn](mailto:wittkuhn@mpib-berlin.mpg.de), Max Planck Institute for Human Development (MPIB), Berlin, Germany

## Who attends (Audience)?

- **Background: **Neuroscience grad students to PIs whoever is interested) from home institutions + surrounding institutions (for Berlin, e.g., Berlin Universities; for Juelich, e.g. affiliated universities Aachen, Düsseldorf, Köln)
- **Numer of attendees:** circa 15 to 30 per workshop

## How does it happen (Expected Course Type)?

* Full-day workshop (remotely or physically, depending on  COVID-19 situation)

## When does it happen (Target Course Delivery Dates)?
