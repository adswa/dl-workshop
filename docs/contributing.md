Thanks for being curious about contributing!
We greatly appreciate and welcome contributions, be it in the form of an issue, quick feedback on the course or its content, a pull request, or any other form of getting in touch.

### Create an issue

Do you have a question, a feature request, found a mistake, or just want to say hi?
Open up an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/adswa/mpi-datamanagement-ws)!


### Create a pull request

 Did you not only found a mistake but also a fix for it?
 Fantastic!
 If you want to make a pull request against this repository, here's what we recommend you to do:

- Create an issue on GitHub about the issue that your PR will fix.
- Fork the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/adswa/mpi-datamanagement-ws).
- Clone your fork.
- In your clone, check out a new branch. Try to give the branch a meaningful name, for example the number of the issue you have created: ``git checkout -b fix-issue-8``
- Make your changes. This website is written in MarkDown - you can find a style guide [here](https://google.github.io/styleguide/docguide/style.html).
- The website is build with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). If you want to preview your changes, build the website locally by installing the requirements in the root of the repository (``pip install -r requirements.txt``) and running ``mkdocs serve``. The website will be build and served at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
- If your satisfied, ``add`` and ``commit`` your changes.
- Afterwards, push them to your fork of the repository on GitHub. The command will likely look like this: ``git push origin <yourbranchname>``
- Finally, you will be able to open up a pull request online by clicking "create PR" in the web interface.

This was only a quick rundown of the steps towards a pull request.
A more in depth explanation can be found in [GitHub's docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests), but you can always reach out to us via an [issue](https://github.com/adswa/mpi-datamanagement-ws/issues/new) and we will provide assistance.

## Thanks for contributing!
